# Amazon CloudFront: Global Content Delivery

**Amazon CloudFront** is a Content Delivery Network (CDN) service built for high performance, security, and developer convenience.

### What is it?

CloudFront delivers your content (videos, images, APIs, applications) to users globally through a network of data centers called "Edge Locations". When a user requests content, they are routed to the nearest edge location, ensuring the fastest possible delivery.

### Key Features

- **Global Network:** Over 600+ Points of Presence (PoPs) worldwide.
- **Security:** Protection against DDoS (AWS Shield) and application attacks (AWS WAF).
- **Speed:** Caches content at the edge to reduce load on your origin servers and improve latency for users.
- **Programmable:** Use CloudFront Functions or Lambda@Edge to customize content delivery logic.

### Use Cases

- Accelerating static website content delivery.
- Streaming video (VOD or Live).
- API acceleration.
- Software distribution (OS updates, game patches).

### Why use it?

It dramatically improves the user experience by making your website or application load faster, no matter where your users are located in the world.
