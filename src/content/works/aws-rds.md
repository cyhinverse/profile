# Amazon RDS: Managed Relational Databases

**Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS)** makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud.

### What is it?

RDS manages the tedious tasks of database administration (backups, software patching, automatic failure detection, and recovery) so you can focus on your application.

### Key Features

- **Multi-Engine Support:** Supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle Database, SQL Server, and Amazon Aurora.
- **High Availability:** Multi-AZ deployments allow for automatic failover in case of hardware failure.
- **Performance:** Provisioned IOPS storage for fast, predictable performance.
- **Security:** Network isolation using VPC, encryption at rest, and encryption in transit.

### Use Cases

- Traditional web applications (e-commerce, CMS).
- Enterprise applications (ERP, CRM).
- Mobile and online games requiring a relational backend.

### Why use it?

You get the power of a familiar relational database without the headache of managing the underlying infrastructure and maintenance.
