# Amazon EC2: Your Virtual Server in the Cloud

**Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)** is a web service that provides different types of resizable computing capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers.

### What is it?

Think of EC2 as a remote computer that you can rent. You can choose the CPU, RAM, and Storage capacity you need, and you only pay for what you use.

### Key Features

- **Scalability:** Launch as many or as few virtual servers as you need. Scale up or down within minutes.
- **Control:** You have complete control over your instances, including root access and the ability to interact with them as you would any machine.
- **Flexibility:** Choose from multiple operating systems (Linux, Windows) and instance types tailored for different use cases (Compute Optimized, Memory Optimized, GPU, etc.).
- **Reliability:** Amazon offers a 99.99% availability SLA for each EC2 region.

### Use Cases

- Hosting websites and web applications.
- Running enterprise applications (SAP, SharePoint).
- High-performance computing (HPC).
- Deep learning and machine learning training.

### Why use it?

It eliminates the need to invest in hardware specifically, so you can develop and deploy applications faster.
