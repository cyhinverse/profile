### Key Features

- **Performance:** Consistently delivers single-digit millisecond response times.
- **Serverless:** No servers to provision or manage.
- **Scalability:** Virtually unlimited throughput and storage. It scales horizontally.
- **Integrated:** Built-in security, backup and restore, and in-memory caching (DAX).

### Use Cases

- Mobile backends.
- Gaming (player profiles, leaderboards).
- Ad tech (storing user impressions).
- IoT (Internet of Things) functionality.
- Shopping carts (high-volume e-commerce).

### Why use it?

When your application needs to handle millions of requests per second with ultra-low latency, DynamoDB is the go-to solution.
