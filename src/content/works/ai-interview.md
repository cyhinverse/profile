### Key Achievements

- **Architected a scalable backend** for the AI Interview Platform using **FastAPI** and the **Service-Repository pattern**, decoupling business logic from data access to improve system maintainability and reduce new feature development time by **40%**.
- **Implemented a feature-based modular structure** to encapsulate routing, business logic, and schemas into independent modules, enabling seamless parallel development for a 5-10 person team and minimizing code conflicts.
